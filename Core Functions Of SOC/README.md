🛡️ Core Functions of a Security Operations Center (SOC)
Welcome to this repository dedicated to understanding the core functions of a Security Operations Center (SOC) — the beating heart of an organization's cybersecurity defense.

This guide reflects my personal exploration and hands-on learning in cybersecurity operations, designed to be a helpful resource for beginners, practitioners, and anyone curious about how a SOC works.

🚨 What is a SOC?
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. It consists of a team of cybersecurity professionals responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.

🧠 Core Functions of a SOC
Below are the five core functions of an effective SOC:

🔍 Security Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of networks, systems, endpoints, and applications.
Detects unusual or malicious behavior using tools like SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, etc.
Provides real-time visibility into threats.
Tools Used: Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar, Suricata, Zeek

🧪 Incident Detection

Analyzes log data and telemetry to identify potential security incidents.
Uses techniques such as correlation rules, threat intelligence, and anomaly detection.
Focuses on minimizing detection time (MTTD).
Includes: Alert triaging, use-case development, threat hunting

🚑 Incident Response

Takes immediate actions when a threat is confirmed:
Containment
Eradication
Recovery
Coordinates with other teams to remediate attacks and prevent escalation.
Maintains documentation and post-incident analysis.
Frameworks: NIST IR Lifecycle, MITRE ATT&CK

📊 Log Collection and Management

Collects logs from various sources: firewalls, servers, endpoints, cloud, apps.
Ensures logs are normalized, time-synced, and securely stored.
Critical for forensics, compliance, and threat detection.
Forwarders and Aggregators: Syslog, Splunk Universal Forwarder, Beats (Filebeat, Winlogbeat)

📚 Threat Intelligence and Reporting

Integrates Threat Intelligence Feeds (TI) to enhance detection capabilities.
Generates dashboards and reports for technical and executive audiences.
Tracks KPIs like MTTD, MTTR, alert volume, false positives.
Examples: STIX/TAXII, MISP, OpenCTI, Threat Intelligence Platforms

# 📊 Splunk Log Monitoring Setup on Ubuntu

This project demonstrates the complete implementation of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Universal Forwarder to enable centralized log collection, real-time monitoring, and analysis. This setup is ideal for beginners and aspiring SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts to practice foundational SIEM skills.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Splunk Enterprise** (Installed on Windows as the central server)
- **Splunk Universal Forwarder** (Installed on Ubuntu to send logs)
- **Ubuntu Server** (Client system running in VMware)
- **PuTTY** (SSH client to connect to Ubuntu)
- **UFW Firewall** (Used to open ports like 9997/TCP for forwarding)

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Set up Splunk log monitoring with Ubuntu as the log source and Splunk Enterprise on Windows as the log receiver, enabling SOC-level visibility into authentication and system activity logs.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 🔹 1. Install Splunk Enterprise on Windows

- Visit the official Splunk download page:  
  👉 [https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html)
- Install Splunk Enterprise on your Windows machine.
- During setup, create admin credentials (username & password).
- Once installed, access the Splunk dashboard at:  
  📍 [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

### 🔹 2. Set Up Ubuntu Server (Client Side)

- Install Ubuntu Server on VMware
- After installation, open PuTTY and connect via SSH:
  ```bash
  ssh your_username@<ubuntu_ip_address>
  ```

---

### 🔹 3. Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on Ubuntu

**Step 1: Allow required firewall ports**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9997/tcp
```

**Step 2: Download the Splunk Universal Forwarder installer**
```bash
wget https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.4.3/linux/splunkforwarder-9.4.3-linux-amd64.deb
```

**Step 3: Install the downloaded package**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i splunkforwarder-9.4.3-linux-amd64.deb
```

---

### 🔹 4. Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder

Navigate to Splunk Forwarder directory:
```bash
cd /opt/splunkforwarder/bin
```

Start the Splunk Forwarder:
```bash
sudo ./splunk start --accept-license
```

Enable it to start on system boot:
```bash
sudo ./splunk enable boot-start
```

Add the Splunk Enterprise server as a forwarding target:
```bash
sudo ./splunk add forward-server <SPLUNK_SERVER_IP>:9997 -auth admin:admin
```

Add the log file to be monitored (e.g., auth.log):
```bash
sudo ./splunk add monitor /var/log/auth.log -auth admin:admin
```

Restart Splunk Forwarder:
```bash
sudo ./splunk restart
```

---

### 🔹 5. Enable Receiving on Splunk Enterprise (Windows)

- Login to Splunk Enterprise at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Navigate to: **Settings → Forwarding and Receiving → Configure Receiving**
- Click "New Receiving Port", enter port **9997**, and save.

---

## ✅ Expected Output After Setup

- Ubuntu’s `/var/log/auth.log` entries will be forwarded to the Splunk Enterprise server.
- Navigate to:  
  **Search & Reporting → Data Summary → Hosts**  
  Select the Ubuntu host
- Search and analyze logs in real-time.
